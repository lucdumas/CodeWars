# CodeWars Challenges:
As of the past couple months, I try to do a CodeWar problem or two to work on my JS fundamentals

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** JavaScript

Here's where you can go to town on how you actually built this thing. Write as much as you can here, it's totally fine if it's not too much just make sure you write *something*. If you don't have too much experience on your resume working on the front end that's totally fine. This is where you can really show off your passion and make up for that ten fold.

## Optimizations
I consistently refactor and optimize my code, sometimes for efficiency, sometimes for readability.

## Lessons Learned:

A big lesson has been realizing the vast amount that I do not know and need to work on!
